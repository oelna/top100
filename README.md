# Top 100

## Rank things that are difficult to rank

This is a project based on https://slimedrippings.tumblr.com/gamefaqssort, which is in turn based on http://blingbling.konjiki.jp/bbst.html (now offline). It makes it possible to order a list of items by continuously prompting you to weigh two options against each other. A couple hundred decisions later and you have a nice result.

I expanded upon the original concept by making it easy to add custom word lists and rank arbitrary items. I cleaned up and modernized the code where I could. It could probably be made even more straightforward by modularizing it. I'm open to suggestions.

I kept the original text on the site for now. The default set of terms is a list of 128 games.
